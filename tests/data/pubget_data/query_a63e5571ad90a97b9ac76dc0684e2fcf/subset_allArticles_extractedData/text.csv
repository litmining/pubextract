"," 
## Background 
  
Total arch replacement (TAR) with Frozen elephant trunk (FET) treatment of acute DeBakey type I aortic dissection (ADIAD) is complicated, carries a high complication/mortality risk and remains controversial on the optimal hypothermic level, cerebral perfusion and visceral organ protection strategy. We developed a new strategy named “Brain-Heart-first” in which the surgical procedures and the management of cardiac perfusion/cerebral protection during Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) were redesigned, and TAR with FET technique can be performed under mild hypothermia with satisfactory outcomes. 


## Objective 
  
Our aims were to describe a new surgical strategy under mild hypothermia (≥30°C) for the treatment of ADIAD and to report the operative outcomes of 215 patients. 


## Methods 
  
We conducted a retrospective analysis of 215 consecutive cases of ADIAD treated with our new strategy. 


## Results 
  
The durations of CPB, aortic cross-clamping, antegrade cerebral perfusion, operation, mechanical ventilation support, and Intensive Care Unit stay were 139.7 ± 52.3 min, 55.6 ± 27.4 min, 14.1 ± 3.1 min, 6.0 ± 1.7 h, 40.0 h and 4.0 d, respectively. The 30-day mortality was 9.8%, with cerebral stroke occurring in nine patients (4.2%), paraplegia in one patient (0.5%) and postoperative renal injury requiring dialysis in 21 patients (9.8%). The blood transfusion of red blood cells and fresh frozen plasma during surgery and the first 24 h after surgery was 4.0 u and 200.0 ml, respectively. 


## Conclusions 
  
The Brain-Heart-first strategy can be widely used with low technical and resource requirements and provides a safe alternative for conventional TAR with FET technique in ADIAD patients with satisfactory operative results.

## Introduction 
  
Although the application of total arch replacement (TAR) combined with frozen elephant trunk (FET) technique in acute DeBakey type I aortic dissection (ADIAD) still remains controversial, it has evolved as an accepted choice for patients with aortic disease involving the aortic arch and supra-arch branches (including ADIAD) ( – ). However, this technique is an extended, complex, time-consuming and skill-demanding surgical strategy ( – ). Deep hypothermic circulatory arrest (DHCA) seems to be necessary, and therefore different strategies of cerebral perfusion (unilateral/bilateral and antegrade/retrograde cerebral perfusion) are developed ( – ). There is no consensus on the optimal hypothermia level (mild, moderate, or deep), cerebral perfusion, and visceral organ protection currently. Various modifications of the technique [hybrid procedures or new devices, such as triple-branched stent graft ( ) and custom-made E-Vita graft ( )] have been reported to dispense the constraint of DHCA, decrease the operative invasiveness, and increase safety by optimizing or simplifying the procedures ( – ). However, the application of these modified techniques is limited due to their inherent deficiencies, e.g., restricted surgical indications, requirement for well-equipped hybrid surgical units, and necessity of validation through long-term clinical trials ( – ). Conventional TAR with FET technique is still the mainstream choice for ADIAD. Based on our preliminary improvement on the conventional technique (the Arch-first strategy) ( ), we further optimized and redesigned the conventional TAR with FET procedure to decrease the difficulty in operation, shorten operation time, reduce postoperative complications and 30-day mortality. This optimized procedure can be performed under mild hypothermia (≥30°C) and was designated as the “Brain-Heart-first” strategy. In the present study, we described the modifications and surgical outcomes retrospectively. 


## Materials and Methods 
  
### Patient Enrollment 
  
A total of 215 consecutive patients with ADIAD who underwent treatment using our new Brain-Heart-first strategy under mild hypothermia (≥30°C) by a single surgical team were enrolled between May 1, 2017 and December 31, 2020. The preoperative characteristics of patients are listed in  .

### Surgical Procedures 
  
General anesthesia was administered. Two atrial pressure lines (1 left radial and 1 left/right pedal) and a transesophageal echocardiographic monitoring probe were placed routinely. Bilateral regional cerebral oxygen saturation was monitored using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) (CAS Medical systems, Inc., Branford, CT, USA). Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) was instituted through the right atria to the right axillary artery by cannulation (one end of the Y-shaped arterial perfusion cannula is inserted into the right axillary artery). Femoral artery cannulation was performed if necessary, e.g., when the pumping pressure was >250 mmHg. CPB was initiated with a flow rate of 2.0-2.4 L/m /min, and systemic cooling was commenced to induce mild hypothermia. During the cooling phase, the ascending aorta was replaced using a 4-branched graft, and the aorta root/valve/coronary was reconstructed or replaced if necessary. Approximately 4-5cm length was reserved at the proximal end of the 4-branched graft to cross-clamping during the potential reoperation ( ). 
  
The surgical procedures of the Brain-Heart-first strategy.   (A)   One end of the Y-shaped arterial perfusion cannula (a) is inserted into the right axillary artery to supply the body. The ascending aorta is replaced using a 4-branched graft, and the aortic root/valve/coronary is reconstructed or replaced if necessary.   (B)   The LCCA is anastomosed with the 2nd branch of the 4-branched graft, and the IA and LSA supply the cerebral circulation system temporarily.   (C)   The other end of the Y-shaped arterial perfusion cannula (b) is connected with the 1st branch of the 4-branched graft, and the trunk of the graft is cross-clamped between the 2nd and the 3rd branches after de-airing adequately. Continuous perfusion to the heart and LCCA is achieved. The blood pressure of the LCCA is monitored by an arterial pressure catheter (c) and adjusted by partially clamping the perfusion tube in the 1st branch (d).   (D)   The stented graft is inserted into the true lumen of the descending aorta and anastomosed with the 4-branched graft.   (E)   The perfusion in the lower body is resumed, and the LSA is anastomosed with the 3rd branch of the 4-branched graft.   (F)   The perfusion tube is transferred from the first branch to the 4th branch of the 4-branched graft, and the IA is anastomosed with the 1st branch. LCCA, left common carotid artery; IA, innominate artery; LSA, left subclavian artery. 
  
After reconstruction of the ascending aorta and/or aortic root, the left common carotid artery (LCCA) was anastomosed with the second branch of the 4-branched graft, and the innominate artery (IA) and the left subclavian artery (LSA) supplied the cerebral circulation system temporarily ( ). Then, the other end of the Y-shaped arterial perfusion cannula was connected with the first branch of the 4-branched graft, and the trunk of the 4-branched graft was cross-clamped between the second and the third branches to obtain enough operation space to complete the distal anastomosis between the trunk of 4-branched graft and the stented graft. The LCCA was then de-clamped after de-airing, and continuous perfusion to the heart and the LCCA was achieved ( ). The blood pressure of the LCCA was monitored by an arterial pressure catheter in the second branch. Then the pressure of LCCA was adjusted to be equal to the blood pressure of the left radial artery by partially clamping the perfusion tube in the first branch to balance the cerebral flow rate and avoid excessive irrigation ( ). After that, the LSA was cross-clamped, ligatured, and cut off. The perfusion flow rate was decreased to 1.0-1.2 L/m /min and the IA was cross-clamped, ligatured, and cut off. Meanwhile, the perfusion flow rate was regulated based on pump pressure and NIRS monitoring to ensure the fluctuation of rSO  and the blood pressure in the LCCA of <10% above or below the baseline. Then, the circulatory arrest of the lower body was instituted. The aorta arch was transected at the end part of zone-0 or the initial part of zone-1 ( ) ( ). After clarifying the true and false lumen carefully, a 12-cm CRONUS stented graft (Microport Scientific Corp, Shanghai, China) was inserted into the true lumen of the descending aorta under direct vision, and the stented graft was anastomosed to the adventitia end-to-end with the 4-branched graft ( ). After anastomosis and de-airing, the clamps on the trunk of 4-branched graft and the clamp on the perfusion tube in the first branch were removed, and the perfusion in the lower body was resumed, the CPB flow rate was returned to 2.0-2.4 L/m /min, then the LSA was anastomosed with the third branch of the 4-branche graft ( ). Rewarming was initiated when the SvO  (oxygen saturation of mixed venous blood) reached >70%. After the LSA was anastomosed, the blood pressure of the left radial artery was recovered, and then the arterial pressure catheter in the second branch could be removed. The perfusion tube was transferred from the first branch to the fourth branch of the 4-branched graft (reducing the perfusion flow rate to 8 ml/kg.min within 10 s), and the IA was anastomosed with the first branch finally ( ). After rewarming, the patient was weaned from CPB, and the remainder of the procedures, including securing hemostasis and sternal closure, was routinely performed. 


### Follow-Up 
  
All survivors were contacted by telephone or direct interviews. They were followed up by means of general examination, computed tomography angiography and/or echocardiography before discharge, at 3 months after surgery, and annually thereafter.

### Postoperative Outcomes 
  
The median duration of mechanical ventilation support (MVS), Intensive Care Unit (ICU) stay, and hospitalization were 40.0 h, 4.0 days, and 16.0 days, respectively. The median amounts of red blood cells (RBC) and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) transfusion during surgery and the first 24 h after surgery were 4.0 u and 200.0 ml, respectively. The drainage within the first 24 h after surgery was 640.0 ml. Of the 215 patients, 88 (40.9%) had postoperative acute kidney injury (AKI, using Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes classification, KDIGO): 41 (19.1%) in stage 1, 15 (7.0%) in stage 2, and 32 (14.9%) in stage 3. Renal injury requiring dialysis occurred in 21 patients (9.8%). For the 39 patients with preoperative renal injury (creatinine clearance rate < 50 ml/min), 20 (51.3%) had their renal function recovered to normal, 3 (7.7%), 3 (7.7%), and 13 (33.3%) had stage 1, 2, 3 postoperative AKI, respectively. Postoperative cerebral stroke occurred in nine patients (4.2%), and paraplegia in one patient (0.5%). The 30-day mortality was 9.8% (21/215 patients) ( ,  ).

### Follow-Up Data 
  
Of the 215 patients, 21 were died in 30 days after surgery. For the other 194 patients, 2 were lost to follow-up; 192 (99.0%) completing an average follow-up of 19.9 ± 13.2 months, 16 of which died during follow-up (2 unidentified sudden deaths and 14 non- ADIAD-associated deaths), resulting in a survival rate of 91.7% (176/192 patients). There was 1 (0.5%) requirement for reoperation (aortic valve replacement due to recurrent moderate-severe aortic regurgitation during the David procedure). No other patients need reintervention for the progressive descending aorta enlargement or anastomotic leak. The patients with postoperative paraplegia who survived had their physical strength recovered to normal gradually after cerebrospinal fluid drainage. 



## Discussion 
  
The conventional TAR with FET procedure for patients with ADIAD requires deep or moderate hypothermic circulatory arrest (HCA) in the absence of hybrid procedures or new devices, which means longer cooling and rewarming phase and brings specific challenges in cardiac, neurologic, and distal organ protection ( – ). Our new surgical strategy reported satisfactory outcomes which were comparable to the published results of extensive surgical repair by the high-volume centers ( – ). Two main modifications were made in the new strategy to achieve the purpose of better protection to the brain, heart and other vital organs: one on the order of anastomosis; the other on the management of CPB (including perfusion flow, temperature and the basis of the management of CPB). 

As we known, type I aortic dissection extends from the aortic root (even from the aortic valve, coronary arteries, or sinus) through the ascending aorta and aortic arch to the descending aorta. Conventionally, it was considered that the heart was far easier to be protected than the brain. Therefore, during the past decades, most surgeons give priority attention to the reconstruction of the arch and distal aorta. The reconstruction of the proximal aorta is started after the completion of the arch and distal aorta repair ( ,  ), which would prolong cardiac cross-clamping time unnecessarily. In our new strategy, the order of anastomosis was modified. The proximal ascending aorta and/or aortic root would be repaired and reconstructed first, and then the LCCA was anastomosed. The major technical difficulties of this surgical procedure were the repair of the proximal aorta or aortic root actually, such as valve sparing, sinus plasty and CABG, especially in complex cases. By creative usage of the first branch as a perfusion tube, the perfusion of cardiac and LCCA was resumed after the anastomosis of the LCCA and was maintained during the reconstruction of the aortic arch and implantation of the stent graft. The procedures mentioned above would significantly shorten the duration of cardiac and cerebral ischemia ( – ). As we know, continuous cardiac perfusion could reduce myocardial damage, improve cardiac outcomes, and decrease 30-day mortality ( ,  ). In the present study, the ACC time was significantly shorter, similar results were reported by other high-volume centers using hybrid procedure and new devices ( ,  ,  ). 

In addition to deep or moderate HCA which is essential for conventional TAR, antegrade and retrograde as well as unilateral and bilateral cerebral perfusion have been adopted with satisfactory results ( – ). However, no standards for the application of cerebral perfusion are available. Bilateral carotid arteries are known to be crucial for cerebral blood supply ( – ). In the present study, the cerebral ischemic time was minimized in patients who underwent TAR with FET using the Brain-Heart-first strategy. As mentioned above, continuous perfusion to the LCCA and the heart was achieved simultaneously through the first branch of the 4-branched graft after the LCCA was anastomosed, while the right common carotid artery had continuous perfusion   via   the right axillary artery. Therefore, sufficient cerebral perfusion through bilateral carotid arteries was achieved during the process of the arch and descending aorta repair. The only potential cerebral ischemic injury was existed in the anastomotic phase of LCCA. However, the right common carotid artery and LSA had continuous perfusion in this phase. Meanwhile, the temperature was decreased around to 30.0°C and the time for LCCA anastomosis was 10.3 ± 2.9 min, which would be safe for the cerebral perfusion. Furthermore, the blood pressure of the LCCA was monitored and was adjusted to balance the cerebral perfusion flow and avoid hypo/hyper-perfusion in bilateral common carotid arteries. As we known, a high perfusion pressure allows collateral flow from the brain to the spinal cord, with similar outcomes to those observed under a low perfusion pressure ( ). In our new strategy, a high perfusion pressure (60-80 mmHg) was adopted. Different from the artificial setting in the conventional ACP (8-15 ml·kg ·min ) ( ,  ,  ,  ,  – ,  ), the upper body perfusion flow in the new strategy (1.00-1.23 L/m /min) was produced naturally by the blood pressure, conforming with the physiological characteristics of cerebral perfusion. The perfusion flow rate during ACP/LBA was significantly increased, and effective cerebral protection was achieved as demonstrated with NIRS monitoring, without increasing the rate of stroke. 

The lower body arrest time depends on the duration of anastomosis of the 4-branched graft with the FET graft. The most sensitive distal organ to ischemia is the spinal cord. Evidence showed that warmer cerebral perfusion might help to improve the collateral flow from the brain to the spinal cord, and this blood backflow may contribute to the protection of the spinal cord, which could tolerate ischemia under hypothermia at 30-32°C for 30 min ( ). In our new strategy, the trunk of the 4-branched graft was cross-clamped between the second and the third branches, and the distal anastomotic area was forward to the end part of zone-0 or the initial part of zone-1, which would significantly reduce the technical difficulty of anastomosis and provide enough operation space to complete the anastomosis while ensuring sufficient heart and brain perfusion. The mean duration of anastomosis in the present study was only 14.1 ± 3.1 min without increasing the risk of postoperative paraplegia under mild hypothermia. Therefore, it is not difficult for an experienced surgeon to complete the anastomosis under this condition. 

With these modifications, deep or moderate HCA is no longer needed, and the CPB time would be shortened naturally ( ). It is known that a long CPB time was associated with increased postoperative complications and 30-day mortality ( ,  ). In our cohort, the setting of temperature raises up to mild hypothermia. Shortened CPB and operation time were achieved, which brought satisfactory organ protection and less postoperative complications: the rates of postoperative AKI, renal injury requiring dialysis, stroke, and paraplegia was 40.9, 9.8, 4.2, and 0.5%, respectively. The rate of postoperative AKI in the present study was relatively lower than that in another large cohort in China (40.9 vs. 77.6%) ( ). As we known, stage 3 AKI was associated with higher rates of major adverse events and in-hospital and 90-day deaths ( ). Stage 3 postoperative AKI occurred in 14.9% of patients in the present study. For the 39 patients with preoperative renal injury, 20 (51.3%) had their renal function recovered to normal, and only 13 (33.3%) had stage 3 postoperative AKI, demonstrating the safety and effectiveness of the Brain-Heart-first strategy. The clotting disorders related to prolonged CPB was also alleviated. The amounts of RBC and FFP transfusion during surgery and within 24 h after surgery were 4.0 u and 200.0 ml, respectively; the drainage within 24 h after surgery was 640 ml. Furthermore, during follow-up, the reintervention rate was relatively low. Only 1 patient (0.5%) who underwent the David procedure in the aortic root needed reintervention for moderate-severe aortic valve insufficiency. No other patients needed reintervention for the progressive distal aorta enlargement or anastomotic leak. These satisfactory outcomes are comparable to those observed after proximal or extensive repair, stent grafting, or hybrid procedure performed at high-volume centers ( – ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ). 

In our opinion, the application of the Brain-Heart-first strategy in TAR with FET technique for patients with ADIAD may be able to end the dispute related to cerebral perfusion strategy (unilateral/bilateral and antegrade/retrograde cerebral perfusion) to some extent, and the arch replacement and cerebral protection are no longer the bottleneck. The surgical difficulties are transferred from the “arch” to the “root,” and a surgeon with skills to perform the Bentall procedure may be easily trained to perform this extensive repair. After the reconstruction/repair of the proximal aorta/aortic root, what remains to be done is the four routine graft-arterial anastomoses to reconstruct the arch and descending aorta, including the 2nd branch of the 4-branched graft with LCCA, the trunk of 4-branched graft with the stented graft, the 1st and 3rd branches of the 4-branched graft with LSA and IA, respectively. What's more, the procedure can be performed in a routine operation room with no need of expensive devices or complex operations involving interventional cardiologists and radiologists. For some complex cases or under particular circumstances, or for some surgeons who are not experienced enough, we suggest the Brain-Heart-first strategy be performed under moderate or even deep hypothermia to ensure patient safety. Therefore, we think it may be possible to transfer the results 1:1 to other centers, especially for high-volume centers. 

In conclusion, the Brain-Heart-first strategy can be widely used with low technical and resource requirements and can provide a safe alternative for conventional TAR with FET technique in ADIAD patients with satisfactory operative results.

rhabdomyolysis
"," 
## Background 
  
The correlation between rhabdomyolysis and postoperative acute kidney injury has been reported in several surgical procedures. As a good predictor of rhabdomyolysis-related acute kidney injury, an elevated serum myoglobin level was often observed after total aortic arch replacement combined with frozen elephant trunk implantation. However, the correlation between serum myoglobin and acute kidney injury in such patients had not been established. 


## Methods 
  
Totally 398 stanford type A aortic dissection patients who underwent total aortic arch replacement combined with frozen elephant trunk implantation were enrolled in this retrospective study. The correlations between serum myoglobin and acute kidney injury as well as the 30-day mortality were assessed. 


## Results 
  
Overall, 268(67.3%) patients had acute kidney injury (KDIGO stage 1 or higher) and 75(18.8%) had severe acute kidney injury (KDIGO stage 2&3). Patients who developed acute kidney injury had higher level of perioperative serum myoglobin than patients without acute kidney injury. After adjusting for known acute kidney injury risk factors, logarithmically transformed preoperative serum myoglobin [  OR   = 1.58 (95% CI, 1.26–1.95),   P   < 0.001] and postoperative day 1 serum myoglobin [  OR   = 3.47 (95%CI, 2.27–5.29),   P   < 0.001] were associated with severe acute kidney injury. These correlation persisted after adjustment for decline in filtration via change in serum creatinine (ΔCr) and biomarkers of cardiac and kidney injury, including N-terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide, cardiac troponin I, creatine kinase-MB, serum creatinine and Cystatin C. Compared with the clinical model, sMb considerably improved the risk discrimination and reclassification for AKI. 


## Conclusion 
  
For stanford type A aortic dissection patients underwent total aortic arch replacement with frozen elephant trunk implantation, serum myoglobin can improve postoperative acute kidney injury risk classification. Rhabdomyolysis may be an important supplement to the existing knowledge on the mechanism of acute kidney injury.

## Introduction 
  
Type A aortic dissection (TAAD) is a life-threatening cardiovascular disease. Total arch replacement (TAR) with the frozen elephant trunk (FET) implantation is an effective treatment for TAAD and produces favorable clinical outcomes ( ). However, postoperative acute kidney injury (AKI) exhibits high morbidity (50–70%) and indexes poor prognosis ( ,  ). Since the mechanism of AKI has not been fully clarified, researches on the relationship between postoperative AKI and biomarkers with different pathophysiological backgrounds received extensive attention. Furthermore, pathophysiology-guided strategies are expected to translate into improvements in AKI clinical prevention, diagnosis and therapy ( ). Among them, the relevance of Cystatin C (CysC), a renal biomarker of glomerular filtration, with AKI has been demonstrated ( ). Meanwhile, several studies have shown that cardiac injury biomarkers can improve risk discrimination and reclassification for AKI, including N-terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB) ( ,  ). 

Myoglobin is a small-molecule oxygen-binding protein (18 kD) which is abundant in myocardial and skeletal muscle. However, sMb has been forsaken by cardiac troponin I (cTnI) for diagnosing myocardial injury ( ). A recent study showed that myoglobin is an excellent skeletal muscle damage marker which could serve as an early diagnostic index for pressure induced deep tissue injury ( ). Simultaneously, with the nephrotoxicity of myoglobin elucidated, the predictive value of serum myoglobin (sMb) for rhabdomyolysis-related AKI was reported in many surgical procedures ( – ). However, its correlation with AKI in the TAAD patients following TAR with FET had not been established. The purposes of this study were: (1) detect the relationship between sMb and postoperative AKI, (2) determine whether sMb level can improve risk prediction of AKI, and (3) screen the risk factors of elevated sMb. 


## Materials and Methods 
  
### Patients 
  
This retrospective study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Xijing Hospital and the requirement for informed consent was waived off. This study was registered in the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR2100042849). 

From December 2017 to January 2020, 411 consecutive TAAD patients who underwent TAR with FET at Xijing Hospital. Exclusion criteria was the followings: (1) a history of end stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring dialysis; (2) pregnant women; (3) patients died within 48 h after surgery; (4) patients with incomplete data. Finally, a total of 398 patients were included in the analysis ( ). Clinical data were collected retrospectively from the clinical database of Xijing hospital. 


### Sample Size Calculation 
  
The risk of AKI after TAR with FET was estimated to be 60% based on the literatures ( ,  ). The sample size calculation was intended to detect a proportion of 60% with a margin of error of 10% and a confidence interval of 95%, leading to a sample size calculation of 387 participants. Finally, 398 patients were included. Sample size calculation was determined with PASS 11. 


### Surgical Technique 
  
All study participants underwent TAR with FET implantation. This procedure integrates total arch replacement using 4-branch arch Gelweave graft (Vascutek Terumo Inc, Scotland, England) with implantation of a frozen elephant trunk (MicroPort Medical, Shanghai, China) ( ) in the descending aorta as the treatment for extensive dissections or aneurysms involving the ascending aorta, the aortic arch, and the descending aorta. Moderate hypothermic circulatory arrest (MHCA, 25–28°C) and selective cerebral perfusion (ACP, 5-10 mL/kg/min) were performed routinely in the procedure. Sufentanil, rocuronium, propofol and midazolam were administered intravenously at the beginning of anesthesia induction, and sufentanil, pipecuronium, midazolam were used for maintaining anesthesia during the operation. Postoperative analgesia was carried out with sufentanil and remifentanil. All surgical procedures were performed by the same surgical team. 


### Biomarker Assays 
  
Conventional serological tests of cardiac injury biomarkers (NT-proBNP, cTnI, CK-MB) and myoglobin were performed before surgery and on the 3 days after the operation. Serum CysC and creatinine were continuously monitored at least 7 days after surgery. The preoperative biomarkers were measured at induction of anesthesia. Creatinine kinase (CK) which failed to be proved as a reliable predictor of rhabdomyolysis-related AKI is not assayed ( ). All laboratory assays were conducted in the Department of Laboratory Medicine of Xijing Hospital, using the commercial kits provided by the same company with the analyzers. CK-MB, cTnI and sMb were tested by BECKMAN DXI800 analyzer (Beckman Coulter, America). NT-proBNP tested by Cobas8000 C701 analyzer (Roche, Germany). H7180 analyzer (Hitachi, Japan) was used for CysC test. 


### Definition 
  
Postoperative AKI was defined according to the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) criteria ( ). The primary outcomes were any AKI (KDIGO stage 1 or higher) and severe AKI (KDIGO stage 2 and 3). Any AKI corresponded to serum creatinine increase ≥26.5 μmol/L (within 48 h) or serum creatinine 1.5 times the baseline (within 7 days), while severe AKI corresponded to doubling of serum creatinine (within 7 days) or AKI requiring dialysis. Urine output was not used to evaluate the level of AKI in this study. Creatinine changes within 7 days after surgery was used to define AKI as most articles focused on the CSA-AKI ( – ). Therefore, the internationally recognized diagnostic criterion of AKI was applied to ensure clinical significance. The second outcome was 30-day mortality which were collected with clinical records review or telephone follow-up. Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was calculated using the CKD Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) formula ( ). Oliguria was defined as a urine output <125 ml/6 h or 400 mL/24 h. 


### Statistical Methods 
  
All normally distributed continuous variables were described with means [±standard deviation (SD)] and compared across groups with Student's   t  -test. Median [interquartile range (IQR)] and the Wilcoxon rank sum test were used for non-normally distributed continuous variables. Categorical variables were described with frequencies (%) and compared with chi-square test or Fisher's exact test. NT-proBNP, cTnI, CK-MB, CysC, and sMb were transformed by natural logarithm due to skewed distributions. Multivariate logistic regression was used to predict the standardized odds ratios (OR) of AKI. Two models which include the important clinical covariates in common clinical prediction scores for AKI after cardiac surgery were constructed to adjust ( – ). The preoperative model (Model ) includes age, sex, body mass index (BMI), hypertension, preoperative eGFR, preoperative white blood cell (WBC) and preoperative lactate. In addition to all covariates of the Model , the postoperative model (Model ) includes surgery duration, cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) duration, MHCA temperature and lactate. Then, the ORs of AKI were further adjusted for changes in serum creatinine (the value at the same time point as sMb minus preoperative value) (ΔCr) and logarithmically transformed cardiac biomarkers and renal biomarker, including NT-proBNP, cTnI, CK-MB and CysC. The ability of the postoperative day 1 (POD1) sMb level to discriminate risk for AKI based on the Model  was evaluated using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), net reclassification improvement (NRI), and integrated discrimination improvement (IDI) ( ). Pairwise comparison of AUC values was performed by DeLong test. In addition, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed to determine a cut-off value of the POD1 Ln(sMb) to predict AKI and severe AKI. We demonstrated the non-linear relationship between POD1 Ln(sMb) and severe AKI with adjustment for Model  using restricted cubic spline. Furthermore, stepwise linear regression analysis was used to assess independent predictors for the POD1 Ln(sMb) levels. A   P  -value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Small amouts of missing values were statistically imputed using mean imputation. All analyses were performed with SPSS 19.0 and R (version 4.0.0.0). 



## Results 
  
### Patient Characteristics 
  
Baseline characteristics of patients without AKI, with any AKI and with severe AKI are presented in  . Overall, 268 patients (67.3%) experienced any AKI and 75 patients (18.8%) had severe AKI during hospital stay. 57 patients (14.3%) received renal replacement therapy (RRT) which includes 20 patients (5.0%) received RRT between POD1 and POD3. 30-day mortality was 11.8%. Notably, 60% of our patients are diagnosed in local hospitals and transferred to our institution. In this cohort of patients, 114 (28.6%) patients were operated in <24 h after event occurrence, 168 (42.2%) patients were operated in 24–48 h after event occurrence, 52 (13.1%) patients were operated in 48–72 h and 64 patients were operated in >72 h after event occurrence. 
  
Patient characteristics by different AKI severity. 
  
 BMI, Body mass index; CAD, Coronary artery disease; COPD, Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; WBC, White blood cell; eGFR, estimated glomerular filtration rate; LVEF, Left ventricular ejection fraction; CPB, cardiopulmonary bypass; ACC, Aortic cross-clamp; MHCA, Moderate hypothermic circulatory arrest; pRBC, packed red blood cells; ICU LOS, ICU length of stay.  

 Any AKI is KDIGO stage 1 or higher. Severe AKI is KDIGO stage 2 and 3. All normally distributed continuous variables were described with means (±standard deviation [SD]) and compared across groups with Student t-test. Median (interquartile range [IQR]) and the Wilcoxon rank sum test were used for non-normally distributed continuous variables. Categorical variables were described with frequencies (%) and compared with chi-square test or Fisher's exact test. 5 missing BMI values were imputed using mean imputation in different gender.  
  
Patients who developed any AKI were with higher BMI and WBC. Additionally, they were more likely to experience longer operation time, CPB duration and more packed red blood cells (pRBC) transfusion. They also had more complicated postoperative course including longer ventilation time and ICU stays as well as higher rates of complications and 30-day mortality. 


### Perioperative Kinetics of sMb and Correlation Between Different Biomarkers 
  
Patients with any AKI had higher perioperative sMb levels than those without AKI. While patients with severe AKI had the highest levels in the three groups ( ). The POD1 sMb level increased by 34-fold in severe AKI patients, 19-fold in any AKI patients, and 10-fold in patients without AKI when compared with preoperative sMb levels. The sMb level in patients without AKI reached peak on POD1. Then a rapid elimination was observed that the sMb level was decreased from peak concentration to 27% on POD 3. In patients with any AKI, sMb level reached peak on POD1 and eliminated to 42% of the peak on POD 3. In patients with severe AKI, the sMb level rose to peak on POD 2 and the concentration kept high on POD 3 ( ). Patients with any AKI and severe AKI have a higher peak sMb level and a slower elimination rate. Meanwhile, the figure of daily changes in eGFR is shown as  . 
  
Perioperative sMb levels by AKI status. Each bar represents the interquartile range (25th percentile to 75th percentile) and the black line represents the median. Any AKI is KDIGO stage 1 or higher. Severe AKI is KDIGO stage 2 and 3. 
  
The POD1 values of all cardiac and renal biomarkers, including NT-proBNP, cTnI, CK-MB, CysC and sMb were significantly higher in patients with any AKI than in patients without AKI ( ). Notably, we found weakly correlations between sMb and cardiac biomarkers. The renal biomarkers (AUC ) were also weakly correlated with cardiac biomarkers but strongly correlated with AUC  (  r   = 0.639,   P   < 0.001) ( ). 


### Association of sMb With AKI 
  
Both preoperative and postoperative logarithmically transformed sMb [Ln(sMb)] were associated with the different AKI severity in univariate models. The association persisted after adjusting for clinical covariates and changes of serum creatinine levels (ΔCr). Each unit increased in POD1 Ln(sMb) was independently associated with any AKI [adjusted OR 3.41 (95%CI, 1.67–6.98)] and severe AKI [adjusted OR 2.33 (95%CI, 1.49–3.65)]. Notably, the association of Ln(sMb) and patients with any AKI or severe AKI persisted after adjustment for logarithmically transformed NT-proBNP, cTnI, CK-MB, and CysC ( ,  ). Thus, it indicated that sMb was capturing an unique aspect of the pathophysiology of AKI which differed from the above cardiac biomarkers and renal biomarker. And the adjusted ORs of Ln(sMb) for severe AKI on POD2 and POD3 are higher than the values on POD1.

 Severe AKI is KDIGO stage 2 and 3. Results are shown with continuous log-transformed sMb as the predictor variable. All odds ratios expressed as per unit increase in Ln(sMb). Preoperative Ln(sMb) was adjusted for Model . Postoperative Ln(sMb) was adjusted for Model . Model , age, sex, BMI, hypertension, preoperative eGFR, preoperative WBC and preoperative lactate; Model , age, sex, BMI, hypertension, preoperative eGFR and preoperative WBC, surgery duration, cardiopulmonary bypass duration, MHCA temperature and lactate  . 
  

### Association of sMb With Mortality 
  
The postoperative 30-day mortality of the entire cohort was 11.8%. The mortality (35/75, 46.7%) of the patients with severe AKI is significantly higher than patients without AKI (1/130, 0.8%) (  P   < 0.001). The postoperative Ln(sMb) was associated with 30-day mortality after adjusted for logarithmically transformed individual renal biomarker and cardiac biomarkers. The relationship between preoperative Ln(sMb) and 30-day mortality was attenuated after adjusted for Ln(CK-MB) and Ln(CysC) ( ). Multicollinearity is examined using the variance inflation factor (VIF) statistic and was found to be acceptable ( ). 


### Diagnostic Value of sMb for Clincial Outcomes 
  
The area under the curve (AUC), event and non-event NRI and IDI for the different AKI severity and 30-day mortality of POD1 Ln(sMb) are presented in  . POD1 Ln(sMb) improved the reclassification and discrimination of any AKI [ΔAUC = 0.08, (95% CI, 0.04–0.12), NRI = 0.74 (95% CI, 0.55–0.94), IDI = 0.13 (95%CI, 0.11–0.16)]. The same effect is observed for severe AKI and 30-day mortality. 
  
Prediction performance of the POD1 Ln(sMb). 
  
 Any AKI is KDIGO stage 1 or higher. Severe AKI is KDIGO stage 2 and 3.  
  
ROC curve analysis showed that an POD1 Ln(sMb) concentration of >6.36 (corresponds to sMb = 580 ng/ml) predicted severe AKI with a sensitivity of 76.5% and a specificity of 72.3% [AUC = 0.796 (95% CI, 0.75–0.84)], and a value >7.22 (corresponds to sMb = 1380 ng/ml) predicted severe AKI with a sensitivity of 70.7% and a specificity of 79.9% [AUC = 0.809 (95% CI, 0.77–0.85)]. We found an inverse, but not J-shaped/U-shaped relationship between POD1 Ln(sMb) and severe AKI (  P   < 0.001) which suggest that the risk of severe AKI are positively correlated with the level of sMb ( ). The diagnostic values of other other mentioned biomarkers are showed as  .

Solid line represents ORs; dotted lines, 95% CIs. The extreme 5% of the data distribution was excluded to avoid implausible extrapolation from the extremes of the data. The spline function was adjusted for Model .

### Predictors of Postoperative sMb Concentration 
  
Covariates with a   P  -value of <0.05 in univariate analysis were included into the multivariable analysis (  F   = 47.67,   P   < 0.001, adjusted   R   = 0.49) in terms of association with elevated POD1 Ln(sMb) level. Only weight, iliac artery involvement, preoperative eGFR, preoperative Ln(sMb), the lowest rectal temperature, surgery duration, pRBC transfusion and pH at ICU admission revealed significant influence on the POD1 Ln(sMb) level ( ). All other clinical factors mentioned in this article had no significant influence on postoperative sMb levels. The independent predictors of preoperative Ln(sMb) were gender, weight, preoperative WBC, preoperative eGFR and iliac artery involvement ( ).

## Discussion 
  
This study demonstrated that elevated preoperative and postoperative sMb were associated with AKI and 30-day mortality in TAAD patients underwent TAR with FET. After adjustment for clinical covariates, decline in filtration (via change in serum creatinine (ΔCr), cardiac biomarkers (via NT-proBNP, cTnI and CK-MB) and renal biomarker (via CysC), the statistical significance still existed. This argues that immediate myocardial injury and kindey injury can not fully explain this correlation. Moreover, only 3% patients developed oliguria in POD1, so it is unlikely that the immediate elevation of sMb levels postoperatively can be explained by impaired renal filtration. In addition, POD1 sMb improve the reclassification and discrimination of clinical model for the different AKI severity and 30-day mortality. The analysis by ROC revealed an adequate predictive accuracy of POD1 sMb to detect severe AKI for the optimal cut-off 1,380 ng/ml. The longer duration and higher level of sMb, the increased risk of severe AKI. 

The pressure-related muscle injury causing rhabdomyolysis recognized in the patients undergoing prolonged surgeries, including the spinal, urological, bariatric and some cardiac surgeries ( – ). In these situations, skeletal muscle (mainly gluteal and back muscles) is more prone to hypoxic injury and vascular compromise because of its peripheral location and long-term compression ( ). Consequently, many intracellular and often toxic components (e.g., CK, potassium and myoglobin among others) leak into the blood. Then, the myoglobin triggers the toxin causing renal dysfunction ( ). Although, rhabdomyolysis is currently defined on the basis of CK which has a longer half-time. sMb has been proved to be more sensitive and specific than CK for predicting AKI ( ,  ). In addition, compared with off-pump procedures, on-pump procedures were associated with significantly higher sMb peak concentrations following coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) ( ). This suggested that CPB might exacerbate rhabdomyolysis and increase sMb. It is notable that one study found that sMb is associated with renal dysfunction following thoracoabdominal aortic repairment ( ). However, the study did not adjust for the occurrence of AKI as we did in our models. Hemodynamic management is not only related to rhabdomyolysis but plays a major role in development of AKI. Lactate was added in the Model for adjustment in regression to provide information on low perfusion. The correlation between lactate and sMb (  r   = 0.469,   P   < 0.001) is provided as  . 

This is the first study demonstrated that an elevated sMb level related to rhabdomyolysis is associated with AKI following TAR with FET. Current literatures provide several explanations for the association between sMb and AKI after TAR with FET. First, several studies have illustrated multiple pathologic factors, such as ischemia, compression and thrombosis result in rhabdomyolysis and release myoglobin ( ). As a small-molecule protein, myoglobin can precipitate in the glomerular filtrate, particular in the acidic condition and hypovolemia, finally causing severe kidney damage. The mechanisms of myoglobin nephrotoxicity include: (1) formation of intratubular casts, (2) renal vasoconstriction, (3) heme-induced oxidative damage ( ). Second, TAR with FET could only be accomplished with the aid of sophisticated CPB techniques, including variable arterial cannulation strategy, hypothermic circulatory arrest and selective cerebral perfusion. All these operations may worsen the hemodynamic instability and exacerbate skeletal muscle damage. It has been suggested that femoral arterial cannulation contribute to leg malperfusion ( ,  ). Third, there is a paucity of data regarding AKI undergoing arch surgery. Current accepted mechanisms of cardiac surgery–associated acute kidney injury (CS-AKI) involve hemodynamic perturbation, inflammation and oxidative stress, CPB-related hemolysis etc. ( ). Previous studies have demonstrated skeletal muscle damage is more prominent in aortic surgery than cardiac surgery which further suggested that rhabdomyolysis may be important supplement to the existing knowledge on the mechanism of AKI after aortic surgery ( ). Moreover, study have shown that the highest concentration of serum myoglobin can be detected between 4 and 12 h following muscle injury which correspond to POD1 timepoint ( ). As the results show, the preoperative and postoperative day 1–3 sMb were related with AKI which suggest rhabdomyolysis may contribute to AKI preoperatively, intraoperatively and postoperatively. Especially for those with persistently elevated sMb may stand for more serious rhabdomyolysis and greater harm on kidney. 

Therefore, a sMb targeted strategy to lower the sMb level might be a potential treatment for preventing AKI following TAR with FET. Firstly, to reduce the risk of rhabdomyolysis in high-risk patients, such as obese subjects with the dissection iliac artery involvement, higher preoperative sMb and lower preoperative estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), it might be useful to optimize cannulation strategy (e.g., sidearm cannulation), avoid hypotension, shorten operation time and MHCA duration ( – ). Secondly, alleviation vasoconstriction and reduction of sMb accumulation by administration of nitric oxide, avoidance of acidosis and volume depletion ( ,  ). Most cases of limb ischemia can be solved after TAR with FET. For patients with sustained elevated myoglobin levels, blood purification with a cytokine adsorber might be a therapeutic option ( ). Last but not least, longitudinal monitoring of sMb is essential to more closely monitor disease activity and therapeutic efficiency ( ). 

There are several limitations of the present study. First, due to the correlational nature of this study, a causal interpretation between the elevated sMb and postoperative AKI can not be drawn in this cohort of patients. But our results do suggest a possible causal relationship between rhabdomyolysis and AKI after TAR with FET. Second, despite all of these relationships persisted after adjustment for the decline in filtration and renal biomarker, the renal injury secondary to the renal malperfusion or free hemoglobin due to hemolysis could also work in the strong relationship between sMb and AKI ( ). Although iliac involvement which related with sMb in this study always stands for extensive aortic dissection. We do not have detailed clinical data about the preoperative and postoperative status of the renal arteries. 


## Conclusion 
  
This is the first study to demonstrate that sMb could improve postoperative AKI risk classification for TAAD patients underwent TAR with FET. Rhabdomyolysis may be an important supplement to the existing knowledge on the mechanism of AKI. A sMb targeted strategy might be useful in the management of AKI after TAR with FET. However, future studies with more detailed clinical data are needed to further validate the relationship between sMb and AKI in this cohort of patients.

## Background 
  
Pump-controlled selective antegrade cerebral perfusion (PC-SACP) in total arch replacement (TAR) can regulate cerebral flow accurately, which might be beneficial for cerebral protection. However, the safety of PC-SACP for TAR combined with frozen elephant trunk implantation (FET) in patients with acute Type A dissections (ATAAD) is ambiguous. 


## Methods 
  
A total of 192 patients with ATAAD underwent TAR at our institution from October 2019 to July 2021. The patients were divided into two groups based on PC-SACP used: PC group (SACP carried out by using a separate pump,   n   = 35) and Control group (SACP carried out as a traditional method,   n   = 157). Patients under PC-SACP were propensity-score matched to patients without PC-SACP, resulting in 35 pairs of patients. 


## Results 
  
Preoperative characteristics, including age, gender, weight, and preoperative creatinine level, were similar between the two groups. Cardiopulmonary bypass time, cross-clamp time, circulatory arrest time, and minimum nasopharyngeal temperature did not differ between the two groups. However, SACP time (54 versus 40,   P   = 0.001) in the PC group was significantly longer than that in the Control group. The incidence of temporary neurologic dysfunction (5.7% versus 8.6,   P   = 0.643) showed a no significantly lower trend in the PC group compared with the Control group. Other clinical outcomes showed no significant intergroup differences. 


## Conclusions 
  
PC-SACP in TAR is safe and feasible and might be beneficial for avoiding brain injury caused by “luxury” perfusion. 

 "," 
## Introduction 
  
Neurologic protection during aortic arch surgery is a challenging strategy for improving clinical outcomes in patients with acute Type A aortic dissection (ATAAD) ( ). Deep hypothermic circulatory arrest (DHCA)–induced electrocerebral inactivity has been thought to ensure optimal neuroprotection, which reached the minimum cerebral metabolic demand threshold ( ). Moreover, the application of selective antegrade cerebral perfusion (SACP) has shifted the strategy from DHCA to moderate hypothermic circulatory arrest (MoHCA) or mild hypothermic circulatory arrest (MiHCA) ( ,  ). 

An earlier study demonstrated that bilateral SACP (BSACP) could maintain adequate cerebral blood supply at moderate hypothermia without an ischemic brain injury ( ). The coupling of cerebral flow and metabolism is important for cerebral protection, and greater flow might increase the risk of cerebral edema and embolic phenomena ( ). Although the suggested cerebral flow of selective cerebral perfusion is 6–10 ml/kg/min at 20–28 °C with a wide range of cerebral flow and temperature ( ), our earlier study showed that 5 ml/kg/min of cerebral flow was sufficient for cerebral protection ( ,  ), implying that excessive perfusion pressure and flow are unnecessary and should be avoided ( ). 

The application of SACP in the total arch replacement (TAR) surgery has been routinely carried out by using one main arterial line bifurcated for an SACP line and a systemic perfusion line via a Y connector ( ). The flow of SACP and systemic perfusion depends on the resistance in cerebral arteries and systemic arteries, respectively. When the flow of the main arterial line is determined, occlusion of the systemic perfusion line can dramatically increase the flow of SACP, which may cause excessive SACP flow and pressure. This “luxury” perfusion might lead to brain injury. To solve this problem, a pump-controlled SACP (PC-SACP) has been implemented to avoid the excessive SACP that can occur during TAR surgery. 


## Materials and methods 
  
### Patients 
  
Data were collected retrospectively from patients undergoing TAR for ATAAD. Patients with preoperative neurologic complications (cerebral infarction or cerebral hemorrhage), malperfusion syndrome, and concomitant operations (e.g., coronary heart disease, mitral valve disease, and congenital heart disease) were excluded. A total of 192 patients underwent TAR by the same surgery group, including surgeons, anesthetist, perfusionist, cardiologist, and nurses, at our institution between October 2019 and July 2021. The patients were divided into two groups: PC group (  n   = 35, PC-SACP was carried out) and Control group (  n   = 157, SACP carried out by a routine method) ( ). The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of General Hospital of Northern Theater Command, Shenyang, China. All patients provided their informed consent. The diagnosis of ATAAD was based on the patients’ clinical history and computed tomography angiography.

### Surgical procedure 
  
All surgeries were carried out via a single upper hemisternotomy approach, and near-infrared spectroscopy monitoring was used for cerebral protection during surgery, as in our earlier studies ( ,  ). The cannulation strategy in the two groups was to select the innominate artery as the first artery perfusion cannula and the right atrial cannulation as the venous drainage cannula. The right-angle artery cannulation was selected for artery perfusion with the direction of blood flow to the heart. The right subclavian artery and the right or left common carotid artery were used as alternative cannulation sites. The cardioplegia strategy was aortic root or coronary orifices after aortotomy antegrade delivery. The right superior pulmonary vein was cannulated for left ventricular vent. Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) was carried out after cannulation, and MoHCA was induced at the time of aortic root procedures. The cerebral perfusion strategy was based on BSACP, which was carried out by using arterial cannulation, and a 15Fr femoral arterial cannula was placed into the left/right common carotid artery after the brachiocephalic arteries were cross-clamped. The blood flow control of SACP depended on the group. In one group, routine SACP was perfused through the main arterial pump as in previous studies ( ,  ) with a systemic line clamped ( ). In the other group, PC-SACP was perfused by the cardioplegia pump ( ,  ) with the systemic line clamped and A–V shunt opened ( ). The flow of SACP was approximately maintained at 5 ml/kg·min, which was modulated on the basis of near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) monitoring. Then, the frozen elephant trunk (FET) with and without lower body perfusion (LBP) was carried out as in earlier reports ( ,  ). Briefly, a stent graft (MicroPort Medical Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China) was mainly placed into the distal aorta after the origin of the left subclavian artery and the left carotid artery transected. Then, through a four-branch prosthetic graft (VASCUTEK Ltd., a Terumo Co., Inchinnan, Scotland), an endotracheal cannula (Teleflex Medical Ltd., Wayne, PA, USA) with an inside diameter of 5.5 mm was placed into the distal artery for delivering oxygenated blood to the lower body and preventing the backflow as LBP with 25 ml/kg·min of flow ( ). Moreover, LBP was switched to the four-branch prosthetic graft after the stent graft was attached to the four-branch prosthetic graft. The sequence of anastomosis to the prosthetic graft was carried out from the left common carotid artery, proximal aortic stump, innominate artery, and the left subclavian artery in succession. Special attention was paid to carrying out cerebral perfusion by using the cardioplegia pump until the innominate artery was anastomosed in the PC group ( ). The cerebral perfusion and LBP were carried out by using the main pump together in the Control group ( ). After anastomosis to the left common carotid artery, CPB gradually returned, and rewarming started. Temporary pacing wire and a drainage tube were installed before sternal closure. 
  
Application of pump-controlled SACP. (  A  ) Routine SACP was carried out by clamping a systemic line and reducing flow of the main pump to 5 ml/kg·min. (  B  ) Pump-controlled SACP was carried out by clamping the systemic line, opening A–V shunt, maintaining flow of the main pump at 2–3 L/min, and modulating cardioplegia pump to 5 ml/kg·min. SACP: selective antegrade cerebral perfusion. 
    
The application of LBP combined with SACP. (  A  ) LBP and SACP were carried out by using the main pump together in the Control group. The cerebral flow was unclear. (  B  ) LBP and SACP were carried out by using the main pump and the cardioplegia pump, respectively.

### Definitions for complications 
  
For the purposes of this study, temporary neurologic dysfunction (TND) was defined as the presence of reversible postoperative motor deficit, confusion, or transient delirium with complete resolution of symptoms before discharge from the hospital. Permanent neurologic deficit (PND) was defined as the presence of either new stroke or coma with permanent neurological dysfunction confirmed by means of computed tomography of the brain. Postoperative renal dysfunction was defined as a creatinine level >230 µmol/L (twice the normal value). Perioperative blood transfusion was defined as intraoperative and postoperative transfusion of red blood cells, fresh frozen plasma, and platelets. 


### Statistical analysis 
  
Perioperative data were collected prospectively. Analyses were performed with SPSS version 22.0 software (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL). Normally distributed data were presented as group means ± SEM or SD, and non-normally distributed data were presented as the median and interquartile ranges. Student's   t  -test and Mann–Whitney   U   test were used to compare continuous variables. Categorical variables were analyzed by using the   χ   test or Fisher's exact probability test (if necessary). Differences with   P   < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. 

Propensity score (PS) matching was conducted between the two groups to simulate randomization in this observational study. PS was estimated by using the logistic model and matched between the two groups within a caliper of 0.2 PS standard deviations. The covariates were based on eleven clinical variables, namely, gender, age, height, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), preoperative creatinine level, and the history of hypertension, diabetes, stroke, CPB time, cross-clamp time, and minimum nasopharyngeal temperature. Then, standardized mean difference (SMD) was carried out for assessing the balance between the groups, and SMD < 0.25 was considered as “balance satisfied”. The Wilcoxon signed rank test was used to compare PS-matched pair variables. 



## Results 
  
### Baseline characteristics and propensity score matching 
  
After PS matching, 70 patients (35 pairs) remained. The raw and matched data of preoperative and intraoperative characteristics are listed in  . We did not observe any significant differences in preoperative and intraoperative characteristics between the two matched groups. Moreover, all time characteristics were found balanced by SMD. 


### Intra- and postoperative characteristics 
  
We did not find any differences in CPB time, cross-clamp time, CA time, and minimum nasopharyngeal temperature between the two groups. However, BSACP time (54 min versus 40 min,   P   = 0.001) in the PC group was significantly longer than that in the Control group ( ). 

Three patients (8.6%) died in the PC group, and two patients (5.4%) died in the Control group. In the PC group, one patient died of multiple organ failure, and two patients died of sudden hemodynamic changes that were thought to be due to aortic rupture. One patient died of postoperative massive cerebral infarction and one patient died of multiple organ failure in the Control group. We did not observe any differences in ventilation time, ICU stay, postoperative in-hospital stay, and the incidence of acute renal failure and paraplegia between the two groups. The incidence of TND showed a lower trend in the PC group compared with the Control group (5.7% versus 8.6%), but without reaching statistical significance (  P   = 0.643), as well as the incidence of PND. Other postoperative characteristics, including chest tube drainage, the incidence of perioperative blood transfusion, reoperation for bleeding, and reventilation, did not show any differences between the two groups ( ). 



## Discussion 
  
Neurologic injury is a potentially devastating complication of ATAAD, and cerebral protection is vital during TAR surgery. SACP has been demonstrated as the best method of cerebral protection during TAR surgery ( – ). Different strategies of SACP affecting the outcomes include flow rates of SACP, unilateral or bilateral application, duration of DHCA, degree of hypothermia, and blood gas strategy ( ,  ,  ,  ). 

An intact circle of Willis is believed to be the base of unilateral SACP. However, incompleteness of the circle of Willis has been reported in up to 40% of patients ( ). Earlier studies have demonstrated that BSACP offers better cerebral protection at a higher temperature ( – ). Therefore, BSACP was carried out in both groups to maintain the continuous cerebral perfusion through the innominate artery and the left common carotid artery, except when the left common carotid artery was anastomosed to the prosthetic graft. In the present study, we did not find any significant differences between the two groups, except for SACP time (53 min versus 40 min,   P   = 0.001). Because SACP time in the PC group was calculated from CA to the innominate artery anastomosed and the flow was controlled by using a cardioplegia pump throughout the process of SACP, the increased time was spent on the left common carotid and proximal aortic stump anastomosed. The routine SACP used a Y connector to separate the main arterial line to SACP and the systemic perfusion line. The flow between the SACP and the systemic perfusion line depended on the resistance of the two lines. In the Control group, SACP time was only during CA, and BSACP was initially controlled by using the main pump separately after the brachiocephalic arteries were cross-clamped. Then, the flow through the innominate artery was influenced by LBP when CA recovered, and the flow of LBP was controlled by using the main pump as well. So, the cerebral flow was unclear, leading to the possibility of “luxury” perfusion. 

It is easy for a prosthetic graft to be out of shape. Thus, during surgery, some mistakes by surgeons caused the prosthetic graft to angulate, which increased the resistance of the systemic perfusion line and decreased the flow dramatically ( ). Then, the pressure and flow of the SACP line to the innominate artery increased dramatically, which might have caused “luxury” perfusion to the brain and led to TND. This situation did not occur in the PC group because the cerebral flow was always controlled by using a separate pump. Although the prosthetic graft angulation might occur in the PC group, only the flow of LBP would decrease dramatically. The decreasing trend in the incidence of TND (5.7 versus 8.6,   P   = 0.643) might be caused by the effect of PC-SACP, which might be beneficial for cerebral protection, while also preventing “luxury” perfusion of the brain.

## Limitations 
  
This study had some limitations. First, this was a single-center retrospective study, although propensity score analysis was used to simulate randomization. Second, the small sample size, especially in the PC group, might have caused confounder bias. Third, the perioperative characteristics were insufficient, which might have influenced the evaluation of clinical outcomes. Thus, a prospective larger-sample study is necessary. 


## Conclusions 
  
In this study, we found that PC-SACP in TAR was safe and feasible. This approach may be beneficial for avoiding neuroinjury caused by “luxury” perfusion.

## Background 
  
Acute type A aortic dissection (AAAD) is a disease with high mortality, for which total aortic arch replacement (TAAR) combined with stent elephant implantation (SETI) is a reliable surgical treatment; however, it is associated with a high incidence of postoperative stroke. This retrospective study aimed to find preoperative and postoperative risk factors for postoperative stroke in patients with TAAR combined with SETI, and to provide predictive models and single-factor threshold suggestions. 


## Methods 
  
From October 2019 to March 2021, 229 AAAD patients who underwent TAAR and SETI were selected. Patients were divided into stroke group (  n   = 23) and non-stroke group (  n   = 206), and preoperative/intraoperative factors were evaluated by independent-samples T-test/ Mann-Whitney U test/Chi-Square test and odds ratio (OR) analysis. The Logistic regression equation and decision tree were used to construct the prediction model of the probability of postoperative stroke. Bayesian-learning model and 2-order derivation were used to calculate the inflection points of the continuous variables. 


## Findings 
  
Platelet count (PLT), International normalised ratio (INR) value, presence of diabetic history, and cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) time were independent predictors of postoperative stroke (  P  -value < 0.05), and the above four factors were used to construct the Logistic regression equation. As for the decision-tree model, a radical model with higher accuracy in stroke predicting was chosen. Three inflection points for the effect of continuous variables (PLT count = 60 × 10^9/L; INR value = 1.82; CPB time = 300 min) on postoperative stroke were found by 2-order derivation. 


## Interpretation 
  
PLT count, INR value, presence of diabetic history, and CPB time were significant preoperative and intraoperative risk factors for postoperative stroke, and the identification and modeling of these factors can help us to take more active brain protection measures in high-risk patients.

   Research in context   
## Evidence before this study 
  
Acute type A aortic dissection (AAAD) is a disease with high mortality, and total aortic arch replacement (TAAR) combined with stent elephant implantation (SETI) is a reliable surgical treatment; however, it is associated with a high incidence of postoperative stroke. We identified a review of postoperative stroke in patients with TAAR combined with SETI following a PubMed search between 1982 and 10/19/2021, by using a combination of search terms for acute type A aortic dissection, postoperative stroke, total aortic arch replacement, stent elephant implantation. The authors reported that patients with TAAR with SETI had a high incidence of postoperative stroke (10–12%). There are few systematic studies on postoperative stroke in patients with TAAR combined with SETI. 


## Added value of this study 
  
Our study identified 4 independent predictors of postoperative stroke in patients with TAAR combined with SETI surgery for AAAD, including platelet count (PLT), international normalised ratio (INR) value, cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) time, and the presence of diabetic history. To provide more quantitative data for clinical reference, we built prediction models and calculated the thresholds of the above predictors. These results were compared with other previous AAAD studies and cardiac surgery studies, which confirmed the reliability and clinical value of our results. 


## Implications of all the available evidence 
  
The developed predictions model could help to quickly identify and make decisions about the risk of postoperative stroke during TAAR combined with SETI surgery for AAAD, thus providing patients with more active monitoring and brain protection measures. 

 

## Introduction 
  
Acute type A aortic dissection (AAAD) is an emergency disease with high mortality (16–19% surgery mortality and 25% in-hospital mortality), ,  ,   with the natural course of AAAD, its mortality will increase over time (1% per hour). 

For patients with extensive dissection of ascending aorta, aortic arch, and descending aorta, there is a possibility of the false lumen residual after traditional artificial vascular replacement. It is estimated that in only 10% of patients with acute type A dissection of the aorta, their false lumen can be completely eliminated.  Total aortic arch replacement (TAAR) combined with stent elephant trunk implantation (SETI) is a reliable surgical method to solve the problem of secondary surgery for residual false lumen. 

The incidence of perioperative stroke in cardiac surgery is about 1% to 4%,  but for AAAD, the incidence is 10% to 12% in patients who underwent TAAR and SETI.  There lacks systematic study on risk factors of postoperative stroke in TAAR and SETI, but from other surgical studies, we can analogise some preoperative and intraoperative factors, such as disorders of coagulation system,  diabetic history,  and intraoperative blood transfusion  that may cause or aggravate brain injury. 

Our study aimed to identify risk factors of AAAD treated by TAAR and SETI and to establish an effective predictive model and risk threshold, which can help us to make more active brain-protection interventions for patients at risk of postoperative stroke. 


## Methods 
  
### Ethical statement 
  
This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University, and was conducted after written, informed consent of patients. All retrospective data included in this study did not disclose the personal privacy information of patients. (Ethical approval number: B2021-237) 


### Study subjects 
  
From October 2019 to March 2021, 229 subjects were selected from AAAD patients who underwent TAAR and SETI surgery at the Cardiac Surgery Center of Zhongshan Hospital. 

The diagnostic criteria for AAAD were the presence of intimal flap and double-lumen sign from thoracic and abdominal computed tomographic angiography (CTA), and the range of the dissected aorta met the Stanford classification criteria for type A, moreover, the time-span between the patient's acute onset and hospital admission was less than 2 weeks. All patients with AAAD who met the surgical indications were treated with active and timely surgical intervention in our center, and the indication of TAAR and SETI was the extensive dissection of ascending aorta, aortic arch (all patients had arch dissection involvement, and their bilateral carotid arteries remained unobstructed and radiographically indicated no significant interruption of blood flow), and descending aorta. Postoperative stroke was defined as a sudden, vasogenic loss of local or total cerebral nerve function during or after surgery, including both ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes. 

The diagnostic criteria for stroke were that the patients appeared persistent unconscious state (more than 6 h) or other neurological symptoms/signs (eg, seizure, aphasia, hemiplegic, sensory dysfunction, memory impairment) after surgery, after excluding anesthesia factors, head computed tomography (CT) plain scan and head CT perfusion imaging (CTP) would be implemented to diagnose stroke. Diagnosed strokes were classified, with ischemic stroke defined as diffuse brain hypoxia or area-specific cerebral perfusion impairment, and hemorrhagic stroke as intracranial, subarachnoid, or subdural hemorrhage. Then CTA examination of the aortic arch and intracranial artery was performed to provide radiological information for decision-making of the next treatment. 

To reduce bias factors, we selected the following exclusion criteria in this study: pregnancy, cancer comorbidities, organic mental disorders, preoperative stroke, and history of psychotropic or hallucinogenic drug use. In this study, 23 patients occurred postoperative stroke, with an incidence of 10.04% (23/229), including 19 patients with ischemic stroke (8.29%(19/229)) and 4 patients with hemorrhagic stroke (1.74% (4/229)). 


### Operative technique and brain-protection technique 
  
All patients with AAAD who were treated by TAAR and SETI underwent midline sternotomy and routine cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) with femoral artery, right axillary artery, and right atrial appendage cannulation. The surgical procedures were as follows:   1.   Resection of the dissected aorta (The resection extent of the three branches of the arch was aimed at ""eliminating the artery involved in the dissection"". Preoperative CTA was used to determine the involvement extent of the dissection of the three branches, and intraoperative esophageal ultrasound was used to determine whether the three branches' dissection extent was consistent with the preoperative CTA.);   2.   Stent elephant trunk (MicroPort Medical Company, Shanghai, China) was implanted into the descending aorta (The proximal end of the stent elephant trunk landed between the opening of the left common carotid artery and the opening of the left subclavian artery at the original anatomical position.), and deep hypothermic circulatory arrest (DHCA) technique was used in this step;   3.   Anastomosis of the left common carotid artery was used to provide left cerebral perfusion, followed by anastomosis of the left subclavian artery.   4.   Different options for proximal anastomosis were based on different cases of aortic root dissection, in our center, Bentall (13.5%, 31/229), David I (10.5%, 24/229), and sandwich  (76.0%, 174/229) methods were used to complete the proximal anastomosis. Additional coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) was performed in patients with severe coronary hypoperfusion (6.1%, 14/229);   5.   Due to the presence of the right axillary artery cannulation, the innominate artery was anastomosed at the later step of the operation after the recovery of circulation. 

When the circulatory arrest is in progress, the strategy of our center is to perform unilateral selective cerebral perfusion through the right axillary artery for brain protection (with perfusion rate 10 ml/kg/min, nasopharyngeal temperature 22.3 ± 0.08 °C), and when patients had cerebral hypoxia, additional cannulation to the left common carotid artery was used to improve the perfusion. In terms of monitoring, transcutaneous cerebral oximetry monitoring and transesophageal echocardiography were used in all cases. When the lowest relative regional cerebral oxygen saturation to base‐line (ΔrSO2min) is lower than 80%, additional brain protection measures are taken, including intraoperative increased cerebral perfusion pressure, infusion of 50% hematocrit blood products, and lower brain temperature (monitored by nasopharyngeal temperature). 


### Study parameters and statistical analysis method 
  
#### Preoperative and intraoperative conditions 
  
According to the occurrence of postoperative stroke, we divided patients into stroke group (  n   = 23) and non-stroke group (  n   = 206), in addition, considering variable types and their ensemble distribution, we used independent-samples T-test, Mann-Whitney U test, and Chi-Square test to statistically analyze the preoperative and intraoperative conditions of patients in this study (Normality and equality of variance of preoperative and intraoperative conditions were shown in Table S1). P values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. This statistical analysis part was performed by SPSS software (Version 23.0, IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). 


#### Independent predictors and logistic regression equation 
  
Odds ratio (OR) analysis was performed for these preoperative and intraoperative factors, in which a factor was defined as an independent predictor of postoperative stroke when the significance of either univariate-unadjusted OR analysis or multivariate-adjusted OR analysis was less than 0.05 (Odds ratios of preoperative and intraoperative factors were shown in Table S2). Among them, we adjusted the data span of PLT and CPB time (PLT_N= Platelet count/100; CPB_N= Cardiopulmonary bypass time/60), because these two factors would not have a significant impact on postoperative stroke under a span of 1 unit quantity, and this adjustment would not affect the statistical significance of OR analysis. These independent predictors were then used to construct a Logistic regression model (Enter method) for postoperative stroke. This statistical analysis part was performed by SPSS software (Version 23.0, IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). 


#### Decision-tree model 
  
MATLAB software was used to conduct decision-tree modeling for 229 patients in the study. The modeling principle was to randomly select 120 samples for the training of prediction-model construction and used the remaining 109 samples for validating to optimize the decision-tree model. The 50/50 split for training and testing was different from normal (70/30), which was aimed to show that this method applied to relatively small-sample learning problems, and it will achieve better performance when more training cases are provided, and as for the prediction efficiency of 50/50 split and 70/30 split testing, we constructed and validated the predictive efficiency of the two methods, with each method repeated 100 times, and there was no statistical difference in the prediction efficiency between the two construction methods (Figure S1). In the building of the model, we designed conservative prediction models and radical prediction models, and the programming language of construction was shown in Supplementary material - Method S1. 

There was no difference between conservative models and radical models before the generation of the decision tree, but the evaluation criterion of the conservative model for the decision-tree was that the model with a low false-positive rate was evaluated as a high-quality model, and the evaluation criterion of the radical model was a low false-negative rate in the stroke group. 

Moreover, we conducted 100 times random sampling repetitions for the 120-samples-training-sets and 109-samples-validation-sets and the random generation of decision-trees. The above steps were to obtain the ensemble distribution of prediction efficiency, which was used to prove that there were no dramatic efficiency fluctuations due to the randomness of the training-set generation and the decision-tree generation. 

This statistical analysis part was performed by MATLAB software (Version R2020b, Mathworks Corp., Natick, MA, USA). 


#### Bayesian-learning model and threshold inflection point 
  
We used the Bayesian Learning model and Gaussian distribution to calculate the relationship between continuous variables (PLT, INR, and CPB time) and the probability of postoperative stroke. The derivation process was detailly described in Supplementary material - Method S2.1. 

In addition, we obtained the inflection point of the continuous variables by using the 2-order derivative method. The 2-order derivative method was detailly described in Supplementary material - Method S2.2. Moreover, we used Youden's statistical method (SPSS) to verify the threshold results, and the results were shown in Table S3. 

This statistical analysis part was performed by MATLAB software (Version R2020b, Mathworks Corp., Natick, MA, USA). 


#### Prognosis after postoperative stroke 
  
Patients were grouped in the same way as in 2.4.1., after that, mechanical ventilation duration, ICU duration, and in-hospital duration were analysed by Mann-Whitney U test, meanwhile, in-hospital mortality was analysed by Fisher's exact test (Normality of postoperative conditions were shown in Table S4).   P   values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. This statistical analysis part was performed by SPSS software (Version 23.0, IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA).

## Results 
  
### Differences in preoperative and intraoperative conditions between the stroke and non-stroke groups 
  
As shown in  , the analysis results of the stroke group and the non-stroke group indicated that there were statistical differences between the two groups in platelet count (PLT), serum albumin level, serum creatinine level, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level, INR value, presence of diabetic history and length of CPB time.

### Independent predictors of postoperative stroke 
  
PLT, CPB time, the presence of diabetic history, and INR value were all statistically significant in unadjusted OR analysis and adjusted OR analysis, and the significance test results and OR values were shown in  . Based on the above results, these four factors were independent predictors of postoperative stroke. After adjusting the span of PLT and CPB, we constructed the following Logistic regression equation.

In this Logistic regression model, y represents the probability of postoperative stroke for the determined value of PLT, CPB, INR, and the presence of diabetic history (0 or 1). The tests of the partial regression coefficients suggested that no factors in this equation should be removed. 


### The radical postoperative-stroke predictive model 
  
Firstly, we analysed the prediction efficiency of conservative models and radical prediction models in the validation set. As in  A, in terms of ensemble prediction accuracy, conservative models (93.88 ± 0.26%) were higher than radical models (90.88 ± 0.37%), with a P value less than 0.001, which was statistically significant. However, for stroke-patients prediction accuracy, as shown in  B, radical models (93.90 ± 0.30%) were higher than conservative models (92.85 ± 0.39%), with a   P   value less than 0.001. Since postoperative stroke was a life-threatening cerebrovascular event, we tended to choose a radical model with higher accuracy in stroke prediction.

 (A)   As for total-patients prediction accuracy, conservative models (93.88 ± 0.26%) were higher than radical models (90.88 ± 0.37%), with a P value less than 0.001;   (B)   As for stroke-patients prediction accuracy, radical models (93.90 ± 0.30%) were higher than conservative models (92.85 ± 0.39%), with a P value less than 0.001;   (C)   In this model, 0 suggested that postoperative stroke would not occur while 1 suggested that postoperative stroke would occur.

C was representative of a radical model in which the false-positive rate was 3/99 and the false-negative rate was 1/10. 


### The threshold inflection point of postoperative stroke 
  
For PLT, the probability of stroke was  ; for INR, the probability of stroke was  ; for CPB time, the probability of stroke was  . The distribution images of the above functions were shown in  A, C, and E.

  Fig 2   

By using 2-order derivative, as shown in  B, D, and F, the inflection point of PLT value was 60, that is to say, when PLT was less than 60, as a protective factor, the probability of postoperative stroke was relatively high, and when PLT was greater than 60, the probability of stroke decreased rapidly. For relative risk factors, when INR was less than 1.82 or CPB time was less than 300, the risk of stroke was lower, and when INR was greater than 1.82 or CPB time was greater than 300, the incidence of stroke increased rapidly. 


### Differences in postoperative prognosis between the stroke and non-stroke groups 
  
As shown in  , the analysis results of the stroke group and the non-stroke group indicated that there were statistical differences between the two groups in mechanical ventilation duration, ICU duration, and in-hospital duration. Although there was no statistically significant difference in-hospital mortality between the two groups, the high in-hospital mortality in the stroke group deserved our attention. These results suggested that patients with postoperative stroke had a relatively poor prognosis.

## Discussion 
  
AAAD is a life-threatening cardiovascular emergency, and surgical treatment of dissected aorta has always been a top priority; however, the mortality and incidence of adverse circulatory events in emergency surgery in AAAD are relatively high, and how to improve the existing treatment strategy is an urgent issue. TAAR combined with SETI is an effective surgery mode for extensive AAAD, and it is a solution to the problem of secondary surgery for residual false lumen. 

Although TAAR combined with SETI has obvious advantages, current studies find that compared with other surgical procedures, the incidence of postoperative stroke of TAAR combined with SETI is relatively high. A large number of studies have shown that the occurrence of postoperative stroke has a significant adverse impact on the short-term and long-term prognosis of patients, including the length of in-hospital duration, survival time, and life quality after discharge.  To avoid postoperative stroke, the diagnostic tests and treatment measures mainly include cerebral CTA, cerebral computed tomographic perfusion imaging (CTP), deep hypothermia, transcutaneous cerebral oximetry monitoring, unilateral or bilateral selective cerebral perfusion, etc., but considering the consumption of time and medical burden, not all the measures can be applied. If patients at high risk of postoperative stroke can be effectively identified, we can take a more active brain protection strategy to make patients benefit from it. 

The objective of this study is to find the risk factors leading to postoperative stroke by analyzing the preoperative and intraoperative factors and to establish a mathematical model of postoperative stroke. In our study, PLT count (  P  -value = 0.002), INR value (  P  -value = 0.005), the presence of diabetic history (  P  -value = 0.014), and the length of CPB time (  P  -value < 0.001) were the four key independent predictors. 

The relationship between PLT and stroke has been verified in previous basic and clinical studies,  and in our study, we found that PLT was a protective factor for postoperative stroke. However, because of the formation of false lumen and exposure of the aortic middle layer, PLT will be consumed,  in addition, due to the activation of inflammation in the circulatory system after aortic dissection,  the vascular integrity is damaged, which increases the consumption of PLT. Similarly, INR value, another indicator of the coagulation system, is closely related to stroke in previous studies.  The outliers of INR value and PLT count suggest that the occurrence of postoperative stroke can be reasonably explained by the disorder of the coagulation system. Based on the above description, we believed that preoperative platelet transfusion could be beneficial to patients with preoperative PLT count below a threshold (60 × 10 9/L). 

Moreover, we found that if there was a previous diabetic history, there could be a higher risk of postoperative stroke. The circulatory system of diabetic patients is in a pathological state, and the comorbidities of diabetes are involved in the occurrence and development of a variety of vascular diseases, including stroke.  In AAAD, patients are in a state of acute hemodynamic disorder, and the fragile-diabetic vascular system is more vulnerable. In our center, the blood glucose control of patients with diabetic history was determined by glycosylated hemoglobin (HbAlc) level, and almost all patients were able to meet glycemic control criteria with the HbAIc level of 4% to 7%, except for 1 patient in the stroke group who had the HbAIc level of 8.4%. The above description supported that comorbidities of diabetes were predictors of postoperative stroke  .  

As for CPB time, the study of Yi Shi et al. suggested that the length of CPB time (>200 min) was a risk factor for stroke,  and the clinical study of Antonio Salsano et al. also showed that CPB time was positively correlated with postoperative stroke.  These studies, as well as the results of our statistical analysis, suggest a potential relationship between CPB time and postoperative stroke. 

In the statistical model of this study, we provided a Logistic regression model and decision-tree model, and we hoped these models could be used as a reference for other cardiac surgeons to make treatment decisions. In addition, we calculated the functional relationship between single factors (continuous variables) and postoperative stroke, providing three inflection points: PLT count = 60×10^9/L, INR value = 1.82, and CPB time = 300 min, and these more concise results could help facilitate rapid decision making. 

For patients at risk of postoperative stroke, we hope to use more active brain-protective measures, including intraoperative cerebral oximetry monitoring, increased cerebral perfusion pressure, infusion of 50% hematocrit blood products, maintenance of brain hypothermia, bilateral cerebral perfusion, and postoperative pharmacological interventions (e.g. glucocorticoids, barbiturates, etc.). 

In terms of limitations, this study is a single-center retrospective study, which may lead to bias due to the lack of random design. Compared with other relevant clinical consensus and research results, it can be found that our study has clinical value for a wider population. However, the prediction models in this study need to be optimised by multi-center and larger sample size studies. In addition, some other clinical characteristics of the patients involved in this study were described as follow:   (1).   As for ethnicity, multiracial comparisons were not involved in this study, and all the patients undergoing this type of surgery at our center were of yellow race.   (2).   As for BMI, due to the life risk of AAAD patients, patients were strictly confined to bed, and their weight could not be directly tested before surgery. Preoperative weight data were dictated by patients or their relatives, and these non-objective data were not included in the study.   (3).   As for comorbidities, we collected comorbidities information including diabetic history, stroke history, cardiac surgery history, and our exclusion criteria included pregnancy, cancer comorbidities, organic mental disorders, preoperative stroke, and history of psychotropic or hallucinogenic drug use. 

In conclusion, several preoperative factors, including PLT count, INR value, and the presence of diabetic history, as well as an intraoperative factor, CPB time, were independent predictors of postoperative stroke in TAAR combined with SETI surgery for AAAD. We construct a Logistic regression model and a radical decision-tree prediction model for these four factors. There were three inflection points for the effect of the three continuous variables on postoperative stroke: PLT count = 60 × 10^9/L, INR value = 1.82, and CPB time = 300 min.

Elephants are large-brained, social mammals with a long lifespan. Studies of elephants can provide insight into the aging process, which may be relevant to understanding diseases that affect elderly humans because of their shared characteristics that have arisen through independent evolution. Elephants become sexually mature at 12 to 14 years of age and are known to live into, and past, their 7  decade of life. Because of their relatively long lifespans, elephants may have evolved mechanisms to counter age-associated morbidities, such as cancer and cognitive decline. Elephants rely heavily on their memory, and engage in multiple levels of competitive and collaborative relationships because they live in a fission-fusion system. Female matrilineal relatives and dependent offspring form tight family units led by an older-aged matriarch, who serves as the primary repository for social and ecological knowledge in the herd. Similar to humans, elephants demonstrate a dependence on social bonds, memory, and cognition to navigate their environment, behaviors that might be associated with specializations of brain anatomy. Compared with other mammals, the elephant hippocampus is proportionally smaller, whereas the temporal lobe is disproportionately large and expands laterally. The elephant cerebellum is also relatively enlarged, and the cerebral cortex is highly convoluted with numerous gyral folds, more than in humans. Last, an interesting characteristic unique to elephants is the presence of at least 20 copies of the   TP53   tumor suppressor gene  .   Humans have only a single copy.   TP53   encodes for the p53 protein, which is known to orchestrate cellular response to DNA damage. The effects of these multiple copies of   TP53   are still being investigated, but it may be to protect elephants against multiple age-related diseases. For these reasons, among others, studies of elephants would be highly informative for aging research. Elephants present an underappreciated opportunity to explore further common principles of aging in a large-brained mammal with extended longevity. Such research can contribute to contextualizing our knowledge of age-associated morbidities in humans.

## Introduction 
  
Aging is a complex and multifaceted process with species-specific characteristics. Differences among species can be informative, and have the potential to reveal the causes and consequences of aging across variation in life history, ecology, and phylogeny ( ). Instructive species for comparative investigation include those that share relevant characteristics with humans ( ). Elephants are particularly fascinating in this regard. 

Like humans, elephants are K-selected animals: they generally give birth to single offspring, have slow maturation, and long lifespans. Elephants are the second longest living terrestrial mammal, behind only humans ( ;  ;  ;  ). In fact, in a nearly 50 years study of wild elephants in East Africa, the life expectancy of female elephants at birth (mean, 46.7 years) was reported to exceed that of Hadza hunter-gatherers living nearby (35.6 years) ( ;  ). Elephants are one of the slowest reproducing terrestrial mammals, with the longest gestational period ( ) and have an age of sexual maturity and an interbirth interval comparable to those of humans ( ;  ) ( ). They have one of the largest proportional postmaturation to prematuration ratios, possibly surpassing that of humans. It is not only elephants’ general traits relative to aging, but their cognitive abilities, emotional complexity, and strong social ties that make them especially appealing for comparative investigation.

Although humans and elephants share many characteristics of interest, they are not evolutionarily closely related. The separate lineages leading to elephants and humans diverged approximately 100 million years ago (mya). Thus, studying elephant aging in a comparative perspective may reveal key physiologic mechanisms associated with aging. For example, it may prove beneficial to investigate whether elephants develop age-related diseases to the same extent as humans, when living to comparable ages. This is of particular relevance as age-associated diseases are a growing public health issue, and one major limitation of ongoing therapeutic research is the lack of animal models that accurately translate to people. To address this concern, newer, and possibly more appropriate models, like elephants, are needed. Thus, emphasizing the importance of the comparative perspective, the aim of this article is to highlight the unique properties of elephants and why studying them can push aging research forward. 


## Evolution and Longevity 
  
The family Elephantidae was once a flourishing group of the order Proboscidea, living throughout much of Africa, Eurasia, and the Americas ( ). Only three species still survive: the African savanna (  Loxodonta africana  ), African forest (  Loxodonta cyclotis  ), and Asian (  Elephas maximus  ) elephants ( ). Elephants evolved from an ancestry within the afrotherian clade (which also includes manatees, hyraxes, aardvarks, tenrecs, elephant shrews, and golden moles) ( ). Mitochondrial DNA analyses suggest that elephants (as well as manatees and hyraxes) have a common aquatic ancestor ( ;  ). African elephants diverged from the lineage leading to Asian elephants (and mammoths) approximately 7.6 mya, while African savanna and forest elephants diverged approximately 4.0 mya ( ). 

One of the defining characteristics of all extant elephants is their longevity. Wild savanna and forest elephants, and zoo and semi-captive Asian elephants are known to live into their 7th decade of life ( ;  ;  ;  ), with some Asian elephants documented to live into almost their 80s ( ). Wild elephants have been living to advanced ages for millennia, without the aid of science or medicine. Such longevity is rare in any terrestrial mammal, which suggests that elephants have evolved mechanisms to protect against aging diseases. 

In fact, it is possible that changes in gene expression due to DNA methylation can be used as a marker of longevity with potential mechanistic influence. This line of thinking has led to the recent development of various epigenetic clocks to measure biological age. One of the most commonly applied epigenetic clocks (the Horvath clock) was recently used to examine the rate of accumulation of DNA methylation marks in savanna and Asian elephants, and to create a dual human-elephant clock ( ). Interestingly, most CpGs demonstrate opposite aging effects between humans and elephants, including genes associated with respiratory system processes, circadian rhythms, mitochondrial function, and some cancer-related signatures ( ). Researchers have also conducted lifespan estimates of extinct Elephantidae species. For example, by using a lifespan clock, the lifespan of the woolly mammoth (  Mammuthus primigenius  ) and that of the straight-tusked elephant (  Palaeoloxodon antiquus  ) were estimated to be 60 years ( ), similar to what is observed in the extant elephant species. 

Considering their long lifespan, the age at which female and male elephants start reproducing is relatively late. Savanna and Asian female elephants may start to conceive at 11–14 years of age and give birth every 3–4 years ( ). Forest elephants appear to start reproducing later in life, at 20 years of age on average, with interbirth intervals of every 5–6 years ( ). Because little is known about forest elephants, it is unclear whether their comparatively delayed primiparous age is representative of forest elephants in general or is specific to this particular population studied. Nevertheless, while some female Asian elephants may experience an extended post-reproductive stage ( ), females from all three species are capable of reproducing into their 60s ( ;  ;  ). 

Males have a unique combination of behavioral and physiologic traits that reflect the intense pressure to compete for access to estrous females [in general, females are in estrous for only 3–6 days every 3–9 years, see ( ;  ) for review]. Males grow throughout much, or perhaps all, of their lifespan, in terms of stature, as well as body and tusk weight ( ;  ;  ;  ). Males experience musth, unique to elephants, which is characterized by bouts of elevated testosterone and aggression, and heightened sexual activity. Females prefer larger males and those in musth, which may explain why paternity success steadily increases in males from the mid-20s until it peaks around early 50s, after which, it is comparable to a male in his early 40s ( ). This observation suggests male elephants may undergo sexual selection for longevity. 

One mechanism allowing elephants to reach longer lifespans may be their multiple copies of the tumor suppressor gene   TP53   ( ;  ), colloquially known as the “guardian of the genome.” Humans have one copy of   TP53  , whereas savanna, forest, and Asian elephants are estimated to have 19–23, 21–24, and 19–22   TP53   copies, respectively ( ). This is compared to estimates of 19–28, and 22–25   TP53   copies in the extinct woolly mammoth and straight-tusked elephant, respectively ( ). Other afrotherian species, such as the manatee and rock hyrax, have two copies of   TP53  , while Bowhead and Minke whales each have one, respectively ( ). Of the multiple elephant   TP53   genes, only one appears to have a comparable gene structure to other mammals, while the other copies appear to be retrogenes, as they lack true introns ( ). Retrogenes can have functional biological roles ( ). Indeed, genetic variation at some elephant   TP53   retrogenes is conserved across all three extant elephant species, providing evidence of the functionality of at least some   TP53   retrogenes ( ;  ), and functional   TP53   duplicates appear to occur only in the elephant lineage (and possibly some bats) ( ). p53 (encoded by the   TP53   gene) is a transcription regulator [reviewed in ( )]. When DNA is damaged, p53 can cause cell-cycle arrest, senescence, or apoptosis and/or it can stimulate DNA repair, thereby promoting removal or repair of damaged cells [reviewed in ( )] and suppressing tumors. 

As reported recently,   TP53   is activated in response to cellular stresses in addition to DNA damage ( ). Thus, these multiple copies may have various effects in response to cell stress ( ). Elephants appear to have an enhanced apoptotic response to DNA damage owing to their extensive number of   TP53   (  EP53  ) retrogenes ( ;  ) and, as a result, develop cancer at lower rates than expected for their body size and lifespan ( ;  ). Interestingly, Asian elephants appear to develop benign tumors and malignant cancer at higher rates than do savanna elephants ( ). Because cancer is an age-related disease, the prevalence is significant in the context of the evolution of extended longevity ( ). Thus, long life requires a delay or decrease in cancer occurrence, in addition to a reduction of other aging pathologies ( ). In addition to its involvement in cancer, p53 has other relevant associations, including its association with Alzheimer’s disease (AD), and its central role in aging. Thus, elephants provide a unique opportunity to further investigate the potential protective effects of p53 in not only cancer, but aging in general. 


## Complex Social Bonds, Memory, and Cognitive Ability 
  
Elephants societies are a fluid, fission-fusion system, such that group members change daily or seasonally ( ;  ). At the center of elephant society is the family, comprised of female matrilineal relatives and dependent offspring. The tight-knit family members demonstrate remarkable cooperation, moving, foraging, and making decisions together. Families at times join together to form bond groups, and occasionally form an additional social tier termed clans ( ). Families are led by a matriarch, who is the primary repository for social and ecological knowledge. Matriarchs are largely responsible for the survival of their whole family. Families with older-aged matriarchs are overall more successful, in terms of both survival and reproduction. Calves are dependent on their mothers and other family members for social support, survival, and learning, constantly being touched, guided, and reassured throughout the first years of life. While females remain with their natal herd, usually for life, males depart at an average age of 14 years ( ), after which they will join small, all-male groups, albeit with looser arrangements than the females ( ). Similar to other social species, such as humans and free-living populations of baboons ( ;  ), sociality and longevity appear to be positively related in elephants. In addition to being critical for family survival, the oldest females (the matriarchs) provide protection for calves, with higher calf survival in families with grandmothers, and they maintain the social cohesion within the herd ( ). Behavioral aging, characterized by cognitive decline and social isolation, does not appear to be common in elephants ( ). 

Elephants have evolved to rely heavily on their cognitive abilities. Data support that living in socially intricate networks correlates with, and likely encourages, greater cognitive skills ( ). Unquestionably, elephants excel in long-term, spatiotemporal, and social memory. Evidence from both Asian and African elephant ethological research suggests that elephants likely have strong spatial and episodic memories. They appear to navigate complex physical and social environments over hundreds of miles using direct and indirect experience ( ). Other research has shown that elephants retain long-term memory of reward stimuli ( ), can identify and locate more than 100 out-of-view family members ( ), and can spatially locate waterholes over 100 km distances and extended periods of time (more than 3 years) ( ). Elephants appear to have learned to discern between human ethnic groups that vary in their level of threat toward elephants ( ;  ). Elephants also seem to be unique among non-human animals in that they may exhibit behaviors related to “theory of mind”, demonstrating self-awareness ( ), cooperation with one another ( ), mourning-like behavior ( ), empathy ( ), and consolation ( ). 

Elephants’ remarkable long-term memory and strong social ties appear to leave them susceptible to psychological trauma. Wild elephant populations have experienced high levels of violence (i.e., poaching—elephants killed for their tusks). At the peak of poaching in Africa in 2011, approximately 40,000 elephants were illegally killed in just that year alone, equating to a possible species reduction of 3% ( ). Although elephants have processes, rituals, and social structures to respond to trauma, including behaviors that resemble grieving, mourning, and socializing, the magnitude and nature of human violence has disrupted elephants’ ability to use these practices, leading to what has been described as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) ( ). In one example, in South Africa, teenaged orphaned male elephants were uncharacteristically violent, killing over 100 rhinoceroses (an aberrant behavior for elephants) ( ). In addition, male elephants with PTSD were responsible for 90% of all male elephant deaths in their community, compared with 6% in relatively unstressed communities ( ). Calves who survive witnessing their mother (and sometimes their entire families) being killed visually demonstrate an emotion akin to despair. It is possible, and something we are currently investigating, that these traumatized orphaned elephants develop health issues later in life and have accelerated aging, similar to children and wild baboons with higher adverse early life experiences ( ;  ;  ;  ). Elephants’ dependence on social bonds, memory, and cognition highlights their potential in studying age-related cognitive decline, which may uncover specific adaptations in the wider context of the evolution of cognition. 


## Brain Size and Composition 
  
Brain size has been shown to be related to body size, sociality, and lifespan in certain groups of mammals ( ). Species with larger brains (in absolute size and also relative to body size), on average, demonstrate a greater ability to process and use complex information ( ;  ). Over the course of evolution, the encephalization quotient (EQ, which is a measure of how much larger a species’ brain is than expected by general allometric scaling for a given body size) of   Proboscidea   has increased by 10-fold, to about 2.0 for extant elephants. Thus, the elephant brain is twice as large as would be expected for an average mammal of the same body size ( ). The adult elephant brain averages around 5 kg ( ;  ), which is the largest among living and extinct terrestrial mammals, and three times the absolute size of the human brain. For large-brained, long-lived species, there is a need to develop improved aerobic energy production to fuel neuronal activity. When comparing protein evolution associated with brain, lifespan, and metabolism between humans and elephants, a convergent pattern is observed ( ). Specifically, in comparison to their phylogenetic relatives, elephants and humans have independently evolved and share increased nonsynonymous amino acid substitution rates among nuclear genes that code for mitochondrial proteins that function in aerobic energy metabolism ( ). This adaptive evolution of protein structure in elephants and humans likely minimizes reactive oxidative species, helping to reduce DNA damage and preserve long-lived neurons ( ). 

Because elephants have extensive memory abilities, appearing to exceed those of great apes and possibly even humans, it is important to examine specific anatomical brain structures. For example, the elephant brain’s cerebral gyral pattern is more complex with more gyri than in primates, including humans, and carnivores, but is less complex than in cetaceans ( ), which is a predictable pattern given the cortical surface area and thickness ( ). Elephants have the greatest volume of cerebral cortex, with large, nonprimary areas thought to be involved in higher-order brain functions ( ). The hippocampus, which is crucial for the formation and retention of cognitive maps that code for unfamiliar spatiotemporal relationships ( ), is comparable in absolute size between elephants and humans, albeit proportionally smaller in elephants ( ) and has the expected architecture for a mammalian hippocampus ( ). The elephant temporal lobe is disproportionately large compared with that of humans and expands laterally ( ). Lastly, the elephant’s cerebellum has deviated markedly in evolution. It is the relatively largest compared to the rest of the brain size of all other mammals, and the lateral cerebellar hemispheres are expanded compared to the vermis ( ), although there are mammals that have greater lateral cerebellar relative enlargement ( ). The elephant cerebellum is specialized such that it has increased neurons relative to the cerebral cortex [97.5% of the 257 billion neurons in the elephant brain are found in the cerebellum ( )], and the neurons are packed more compactly than in other afrotherians ( ). 

Cortical pyramidal neuron morphology also differs between humans and elephants. Human neurons have basal dendritic trees with a greater number of short branches and a vertical apical dendrite, whereas elephants appear to have longer basal dendritic segments and a V-shaped bifurcating apical dendritic arrangement ( ). This suggests potential differences in cortical information processing, possibly what allows elephants to have such an extraordinary long-term, spatiotemporal, and social memory abilities ( ). 

In this regard, elephants appear to be quite attractive in the study of AD and neurodegeneration. As alluded to earlier, families with older-aged matriarchs are more successful than families with young matriarchs because they rely on the matriarch’s ability to remember critical spatiotemporal and social information. Thus, it is possible that elephants evolved protective mechanisms to slow neurodegeneration. To our knowledge, however, no published reports address whether elephants develop neuropathologic changes similar to AD or related dementias or even the amount of neurodegeneration that occurs with normal aging in the absence of disease. We have therefore begun to examine and quantify age-related brain changes in elephants. 

In our preliminary work, we sampled brain tissue from the prefrontal cortex of a 51-year-old female Asian zoo elephant for immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence. The tissue was stained with ionized binding adaptor molecule-1 (Iba-1), a calcium binding protein specific to microglia and macrophages to detect any differences in microglia morphology. Microglia can clump together and change shape to become less ramified when activated in response to neurodegeneration ( ). In this specimen, the microglia showed no activated forms and were evenly distributed, indicating a normal state ( ). CP13, a phospho-tau antibody that stains against the Serine 202 epitope, was applied to this specimen as well. Tau accumulates in dying neurons and can be found in pathological structures such as neurofibrillary tangles and neuritic clusters in cases of neurodegeneration, including AD ( ). This specimen did not show any neurofibrillary tangles or neuritic clusters, however, some neurons located at the lower margin of the cortical layer III stained positively for tau, as did some pretangles in layer II ( ). This distribution is similar to what would be expected in a middle-aged human, as age-related tau accumulation begins in layers II and III and progresses towards the deeper layers as neurodegeneration progresses ( ). The tissue was also stained with a combination of CP13 and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) using immunofluorescence. GFAP is expressed by astrocytes and the combination of activated astrocytes and tau-stained neurons is an indicator of neurodegeneration. In this specimen there were no activated astrocyte forms and no clumping around the tau-positive neurons. The tau “speckling” throughout the cortex ( ) may reflect axonal damage, or it may be a species-specific artifact. It could also be representative of early aging, and some similar (albeit less widespread) patterns appear in early-aging humans ( ;  ). Investigations regarding signs of neurodegeneration are ongoing in other elephant specimens and species for a better understanding of how the elephant brain changes with age.

Images   (A–D)   were taken on an Axiophot brightfield microscope (Carl Zeiss Microscopy, Jena, Germany), with a 10x/0.32 Plan-Apochromat objective.   (E–F)   Tissue was stained with CP13 (red) and GFAP (green, 1:1,000, Abcam., ab68428) using immunofluorescence (note that blood vessels appear in green due to autofluorescence). Images   (E–F)   were taken on a CLSM 780 confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss Microscopy, Jena, Germany), using a 20x/0.8 DICII objective and DPSS 561–10 diode and Argon lasers at excitation wavelengths of 555 and 488 nm. Confocal stacks in layers II and III of the cerebral cortex were imaged at 512 × 512 pixel resolution with a z-step of 1 µm for a pinhole setting of 1 Airy unit. Images are presented as maximum intensity projections of the Z-stack, made using ZenBlue (version 3.3, Carl Zeiss Microscopy, Jena, Germany). All scale bars are 50 μm. In   (A)  , microglia are evenly distributed and ramified without any activated (ameboid) forms. In   (B, C)  , neurons stained with tau were found in layers III and II, respectively. In   (D)   tau “speckling” is visible in brown throughout layer III, and it is also visible in   (E–F)   in red. Images   (E–F)   show tau-positive neurons (thick arrowheads), and fibrils in red, and astrocytes in green (as well as autofluorescent blood vessels which are much thicker). Astrocytic end feet are visible around some blood vessels (thin arrows). In   (F)  , astrocytes are indicated with stars, note their presence around the tau-positive neuron. 
  
Neurofilament light (NfL) is a highly phosphorylated neuronal structural protein that upon neuro-axonal damage is released into the extracellular space, and subsequently into the cerebrospinal fluid and blood ( ). Numerous reports have been made of the association between serum and plasma NfL and the severity of acute central nervous system injury, as well as the presence and state of neurodegenerative disease, including AD in humans ( ;  ), AD rodent models ( ;  ), and cognitive dysfunction in dogs ( ). To our knowledge we are the first to measure NfL, or any neurodegenerative biomarker, in elephants. We measured serum NfL in 21 zoo Asian elephants (20 females, 1 male; 39.6 ± 16.1 years of age, range 9–72 years of age) and plasma NfL in 9 zoo Asian elephants (7 females, 2 males; 33.2 ± 11.3 years of age, range 13–47 years of age). NfL was analyzed using the Simoa NF-light digital immunoassay (103,186, Quanterix, Billerica, MA). Serum and plasma NfL concentrations averaged 5.6 ± 3.3 and 3.2 ± 2.7 pg/ml, respectively ( ). In one elephant, for which we had repeated serum samples collected at ages 45, 65, 68, and 72 years ( ), we did not observe a general increase in NfL concentrations over time. Using R statistical software (R version, 3.5.2), based on a linear mixed model for the serum samples and a linear regression model for the plasma samples, we did not find a significant relationship between NfL concentrations and age (  p   = 0.275; 0.341, respectively; significance level was determined at   p   < 0.05, 2-tailed). It is difficult to directly compare blood NfL concentrations across species as peripheral factors, such as body mass index, which can affect blood volume and reduce NfL levels, and kidney function, which affects protein clearance, can differ across species. Regardless, NfL concentrations obtained from zoo Asian elephants in either plasma or serum are lower than humans [e.g., see ( )] and dogs ( ). Further data are needed to determine whether elephants are protected to a certain degree against neurodegeneration.

## Conclusion 
  
Despite the phylogenetic distance between elephants and humans, convergence in the evolution of longevity, sociality, cognition, and memory makes elephants an intriguing species for comparative investigation. Yet elephants have largely been overlooked as an animal model that could shed light on the diseases of aging, including cancer, AD, and comorbidities associated with adverse early life experiences. Developing these resources offers great potential for future research. Comprehensive life history and medical records exist for elephants living under human care, either in zoological institutions or in semi-captive conditions in range countries [e.g., records for ∼9,600 Myanmar timber elephants captured or born after 1875 ( )]. This allows for retrospective analyses and adjustment for differences in life experiences and health status. An intriguing opportunity also exists to compare species living in different environments, e.g., captive versus semi-captive versus wild populations. Zoological institutions are not as controlled like a traditional laboratory setting, yet they are more artificial than in the wild. Semi-captive populations fall in the middle, such that semi-captive elephants have access to veterinary care and diet supplementation but can also roam and interact with wild elephant herds. These differences in environment and social access allow for a range of comparative studies within species to examine the possible effects of external factors on the biology of aging. Study of elephants offers a novel and valuable perspective to aging research.
